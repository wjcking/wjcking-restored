<p>Dear  leaders!<br>
  <br>
First of all, I really appreciate it that leaders can get round to browse my  resume. As far as my life is concerned, it is a shame thing that one holds  junior college diploma when he/she looks for a job in  talent markets, so I am majoring in bachelor degree at present, CET 6  examination, though has not been taken yet, I have already taken TOEFL ibt (105)  examination as my personal certificate. In order to acquire a remarkable performance  and better competitive ability in job fair, much more time I need to invest</p>
<p>English  reading, speaking as well as writing which, of course, include academic topics  such as computer science, human resource management and some superficial  knowledge coming from any academic fields, I can also deal with.</p>
<p>In  computer programming field, I tend to use C# as my major developing language.  Being based on dot net framework, it is possible for me to develop excellent  web and windows applications. Moreover, I learnt many useful developing skills in  my work time such as there-tier developing, web service technology,  T-transaction SQL query and so on. What fascinates me is the use of Design  pattern in software-developing field. Combined UML language, Design Pattern  which consists of 23 genres such as singleton pattern, factory pattern,  decorator pattern, observer pattern and the like makes us possible to develop  software effectively. Besides, AJAX  technology is another web developing technology I eager to court. Virtual idea  is one of my web-developed projects embedded in much AJAX technology. Without refreshing web  pages, data can be read easily from my SQL server database is an attractive  feature. Not only does AJAX  economical many database resources, but it provides us a great deal of fun and  user interaction as well. In addition, I know a little web art design such as  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript extra.</p>
<p>In  the end, depending on two years developing experience and one year work  experience, I believe that I will be able to qualify all of the developing  skills and tasks that company require. The only thing I want is a job  opportunity. If it is available, I will do my utmost to do.</p>
<p>I  am looking forward to hearing from you</p>
